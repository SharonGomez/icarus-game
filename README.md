# Icarus
## The planet themed strategy game born out of a 7 day game jam and 5 developers of the theme <em>"The more you have the worse it is"</em>.

On Icarus, having too much money is bad - you lose! However you have an endless supply of money, you must use this to buy resources - but too many and your planet loses health - you lose!
Also there are annoying space enemies that land from space, whom unless you manage by throwing them out would create chaos in your ventures which would mean... you guessed it, YOU LOSE! 
So the question is - how much money can you make before you quite literally BREAK ICARUS APART.

All things to do with the enemies and their chaos were my main contribution to the game along with adding music.
